# Computational Musicology

## Week 6

In this notebook I'm trying to find out what the influence of commercial success is on the sound of a album. Im going to do this by comparing all albums of different artist who (in my opinion) started in a sub culture and became over the span of their careers a commercial success.

Artist I chose are:
- Daft Punk
- Kanye West
